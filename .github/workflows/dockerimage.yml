   # Here we tell GitHub that the jobs must be determined
   # dynamically depending on a matrix configuration.
   strategy:
     # The matrix will produce one job for each configuration
     # parameter of type `arduino-platform`, in this case a
     # total of 1.
     matrix:
       arduino-platform: ["esp8266:esp8266"]
        # This is usually optional but we need to statically define the
        # FQBN of the boards we want to test for each platform. In the
        # future the CLI might automatically detect and download the core
        # needed to compile against a certain FQBN, at that point the
        # following `include` section will be useless.
        include:
          # This works like this: when the platformn is "arduino:samd", the
          # variable `fqbn` is set to "arduino:samd:nano_33_iot".
          - arduino-platform: "esp8266:esp8266"
